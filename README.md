# Breakout-After-Dark
A Breakout clone made in Unity 2D for a University of Maryland Game Development Club Game Dash. It was created in 6-hours as a part of the Game Dash to create a new spin on Breakout

This game takes Breakout into the dark, where the only source of light is the ball, making it hard to see what bricks are left and where the paddle is.
